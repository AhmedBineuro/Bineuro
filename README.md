# Bineuro Implementations
  My attempt at implementing a  bunch of physics systems and autonomous characters. These classes and examples are mostly implemented using AWT, swing, and processing core libraries. **Please excuse the quality of the code as this is primarily a learning experience on how to implent a bunch of systems of interest for the custom 2D game engine I am making.**
# Currently Implemented
  - Autonomous steering,wandering, and seeking
  - Cell based sandbox
  - The bases for Conway's Game of Life
  - Cell class
  - Boid class
# In the works
  - Boid simulation
    - Flee
    - Cohesion
    - Alignment
    - Seperation
  - Higher material count cell based Physics
    - Fire
    - Lava
    - Obsidian
    - Acid
    - Smoke
# To be Implemented
  - Gravity and attraction simulation
  - Ray casting
  - Wave collapse Function
  - Random Dungeon genrator
  - Simple physics
